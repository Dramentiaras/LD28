LD28
====

My github repository for the 28:th Ludum Dare. http://ludumdare.com/compo

This is the host for my LD28 source code. I hope you enjoy the game itself and that you can learn something from my code.
This is my first LD ever and I hope it went well.

If you want to contact me, the easiest way would be through twitter: @Martinoinez.
